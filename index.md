## Welcome to my personal webpage

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Erasmus School of Economics and Tinbergen Institute. I work as a part of the Health Economics group in the Applied Economics department. My research interests mostly lie in the intersection of Health, Labour, and Family Economics.
