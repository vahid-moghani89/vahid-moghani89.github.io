**Abstract** – This paper assesses the impact of a mental health literacy intervention on the demand for mental health support among university students. We run a field experiment with 2,978 students at a large Dutch university. The intervention raises willingness to pay and demand for a mental-health app among male respondents, and shifts information demand from psychological counselling toward coaching—driven by students with moderate distress. Increased perceived effectiveness of low-intensity therapy appears to be the mechanism. A three-week follow-up suggests a moderate improvement in mental-health scores for treated female students, consistent with higher care-seeking.

<summary>Workplace and Health</summary>
<div class="content" markdown="1">
This project studies how firms shape workers’ healthcare use and long-term health. Using Dutch administrative employer–employee data linked to individual healthcare expenditures, I estimate AKM two-way fixed effects with KSS correction to isolate firm contributions beyond worker characteristics and insurance access. A one-SD difference in firm effects translates into large changes in healthcare costs and predicts future disability and mortality risks, even after rich controls, highlighting the workplace as a lever for health policy.
