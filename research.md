## Mental Health Literacy, Beliefs and Demand for Mental Health Support among University Students

_Submitted_

With Michelle Acampora and Francesco Capozza. [Working paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/).

**Abstract** – This paper assesses the impact of a mental health literacy intervention on the demand for mental health support among university students. We run a field experiment with 2,978 university students from one of the largest Dutch universities. The intervention provides information on the benefits of care‑seeking and its potential returns in terms of academic performance. The intervention increases the willingness to pay and the demand for a mental health app among male respondents. It also increases the demand for information about coaching, correspondingly decreasing the demand for information about psychological counseling. We document that this substitution is driven by students with moderate psychological distress. Increased perceived effectiveness of low‑intensity therapy options is likely to be the mechanism. In a follow‑up survey three weeks later, we find evidence of a moderate improvement in mental health scores for treated female respondents, consistent with suggestive evidence of increased care‑seeking behavior.

## Childhood Mental Health Effects of Early‑Life Exposure to a Parental Job Loss

With Pilar García‑Gómez and Tom Van Ourti. *Email me for a draft.*

**Abstract** – We study the mental health effects of early life exposure to paternal job loss. Using nationwide individual‑level administrative register records, we focus on firm‑closure‑induced job losses for fathers with children below age five in the Netherlands. These children are more likely to take mental health‑related medicines in their later childhood, and this increase is mainly driven by psychostimulant drugs. The increased uptake of psychostimulants ranges from 15 percent of mean uptake in the control group at age five to around 9 percent at age twelve. The effects are significantly larger for families with mothers being the main breadwinner, suggesting that the drop in paternal income resulting from displacement is not the main driver of psychostimulant uptake. We further find that the father is more likely to take mental health medication around the time of job loss, and that the children exposed to paternal job loss are more likely to live in dissolved families. We find no evidence of exposed children living in neighborhoods with different rates of psychostimulant consumption compared to control children, while parents of treated children do report more impulsive behavior and inattention symptoms.

# Work in Progress

* **Health Disparities: The Business Contribution** – Using the pool of all full‑time employees in the Netherlands between 2009‑2016, this study will focus on how workplace settings might influence health outcomes. By analyzing the health trends among the movers across firms, this research intends to isolate the specific influence of firm‑related factors, distinguishing them from the personal attributes of employees. This nuanced approach is expected to shed light on the diverse ways in which work environments can impact health. The findings from this study will be instrumental in informing the development of more effective health policies and workplace interventions. These efforts will not only aim to enhance individual health but also seek to reduce health disparities at a societal level. Ultimately, this method will provide insights into the extent to which firm‑level factors explain variations in health expenditures, offering valuable guidance for future policy and organizational decisions.
